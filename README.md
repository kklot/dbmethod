Code accompany the paper 
*Characterisation of age at first sex distribution and within-cohort inconsistency*
Van Kinh Nguyen and Jeff W. Eaton

These include code to run cross-validation in `crossv.Rmd` and neccessary
files. This file calls the `model.cpp`, `tmb_sampling.R` to fit and sample from

sample.
